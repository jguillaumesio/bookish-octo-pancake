Styled similar to cinematography found in The Wachowskis' The Matrix film franchise and gameplay mechanics in games such as Dead to Rights and Max Payne, the player is given an ability to slow down time and thus dodge multitudes of flying bullets and other obstacles. The first level, \"enhancement\", slows down all action, including the player character. The second level, \"Blitz\", slows down only the enemies, allowing the player to move around at normal speed. The third level, \"frozen time\", halts everything around the player, who again maintains normal speed. By pressing the shoulder buttons, the player can lock-onto and switch aim at the various enemies. Successfully dispatching several foes in a row earns the player bonus points, which can be used at the end of a stage to purchase upgrades like more health, as well as special attacks and acrobatic evasion skills that can be mapped to certain controller buttons. The game features four playable characters (Crow, Alice, Dragon, and Boris), each of which has their own unique set of abilities. Between the action sequences, the player must advance the plot through a graphic adventure-style interface, where certain characters must be spoken to in order to continue.","tags":[{"id":1,"name":"Action","type":"themes"},{"id":5,"name":"Shooter","type":"genres"},{"id":31,"name":"Adventure","type":"genres"},{"id":22,"name":"assassin","type":"keywords"},{"id":78,"name":"anime","type":"keywords"},{"id":166,"name":"shoot 'em up","type":"keywords"},{"id":284,"name":"organized crime","type":"keywords"},{"id":301,"name":"health","type":"keywords"},{"id":897,"name":"third person shooter","type":"keywords"},{"id":1025,"name":"shooter","type":"keywords"},{"id":1309,"name":"bullet time","type":"keywords"},{"id":2141,"name":"slow-motion","type":"keywords"}],"videos":[{"id":8837,"video_id":"X54hi6se9E0"}],"similarity":0.8571428571428571}
